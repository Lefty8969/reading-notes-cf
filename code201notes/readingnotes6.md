## Readings: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM


### 1.	How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

* Object literal can be describes as a big cabinet with files and within the cabinet there are drawers and each drawer has files.


### 2.	What are some advantages to creating object literals?

* More concise readability and keeps the syntax more simple
* Can create an object using an object
* Easier to use with an array

### 3.	How do objects differ from arrays?

* They differ because an array uses an index to select an item as for an object, the object uses the value.


### 4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.

* When you are trying to access object property held in a value 


### 5.	Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is he advantage to using this?

* The term “this” refers to the current object written inside the code
* The advantage of using the term “this”, it allows you to create more than one literal object
